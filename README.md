# Population: Effect on International Metrics
## Project 1 Group 8

### Background
asfjlajdlfladjflajksdf;

### Analysis/Conclusion
Environmental analysis:
- One can assume that the most populated countries are the worst polluters, but when looking at a country’s cement carbon footprint, Israel is in second place (China is first and Japan is third). 
- Since we plotted over the span of nine years, we can see trends in the lines and can try predicting the future. 
- 2010-2018 Israel’s cement carbon footprint has been decreasing and by seeing that we can predict that it will continue to decrease (and go below Japan).


Health analysis: 
- In terms of outdoor air pollution, cardiovascular disease, and cancer, there is a strong positive correlation between outdoor air pollution and cancer death rates with an r-value=0.97 as well as outdoor air pollution and cardiovascular disease death rates with an r-value=0.95.
- China is the largest densely populated country and 2nd leading country in death rates for outdoor air pollution, cardiovascular disease, and cancer.
- There is likely a correlation between population and environmental impact with the exception of South Africa.
- The differences are likely due to healthcare costs and availability, nutrition/malnutrition, and economic status.
- Also, infant mortality rates are typically a very good indicator of overall health for a society and the data shows that Japan, Israel, Germany, and Australia have overall better health compared to the other countries.
- China, India, South Africa, and Brazil are countries with the highest infant mortality rates from 2010-2018.


### Gross Domestic Product (GDP) 
Q: Why is GDP important when measuring a country’s growth and economy?
- United States (US) leading the trend for the past 8 years
- China follows in upward trend after United States
- Represents how US and China are strongest economies
- Japan shows decreasing trend from 2012-2016

### Gross Domestic Product Per Capita  
Q: Why is GDP per capita important when measuring a country’s growth and economy?
- Australia shows erratic trend with sharp increase and decrease.
- US has stable increasing trend.
- Japan shows declining trend in 2013.

### Comparing Carbon Dioxide Emissions (Density Locations and Over Time)
Q: Does increasing population increase CO2 releases? Comparing CO2 releases per person, would emissions be the same everywhere?
